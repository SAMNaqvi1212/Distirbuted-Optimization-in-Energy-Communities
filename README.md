# Distirbuted-Optimization-in-Energy-Communities
This repository contains code and resources for my master's project on Distributed Optimization in Energy Communities, which was conducted under the supervision of the Cologne Institute of Renewable Energy. The project explores strategies for optimizing energy usage in communities using distributed computing techniques.
