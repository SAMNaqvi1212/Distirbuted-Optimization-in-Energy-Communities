# Distirbuted-Optimization-in-Energy-Communities
This repository contains code and resources for my master's project on Distributed Optimization in Energy Communities, which was conducted under the supervision of the Cologne Institute of Renewable Energy. The project explores strategies for optimizing energy usage in communities using distributed computing techniques.

# Introduction 
The Master Project comprises of two methodologies to optimize the distribution of electricity across the main grid. One approach is to use conventional mathematical model and other approach is to use custom Reinforcement Learning environment. Both models were built very similarlyto enable a later comparison.However,certain parameters that were used to describe the environments had to differ.The focus of the models was set on houses with PV-generation and battery-storage units. The maximum power of the PV-production was taken from  the data provided. The storage capacity as well as the charging power were sized adequately. The primary price of the grid was approximated were to be 40 cents. The cost of energy storage is 15 cents and the cost of PV source is 10 cents.
